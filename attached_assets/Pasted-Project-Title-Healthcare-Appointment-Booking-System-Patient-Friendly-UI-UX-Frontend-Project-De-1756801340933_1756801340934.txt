Project Title:
Healthcare Appointment Booking System – Patient-Friendly UI/UX + Frontend

Project Description:
I want to build a healthcare appointment booking system where patients can easily book appointments with doctors and hospitals. The main focus is on usability, accessibility, and responsiveness. The UI should be modern, clean, and professional, following healthcare design patterns (calm colors, intuitive layouts, accessibility guidelines).

Core Features (Frontend):

Landing Page

Hero section with a clear "Book Appointment" CTA.

Info about services (doctors, specializations, hospitals).

Search bar for doctors/hospitals by name, specialization, or location.

Appointment Booking Flow

Step 1: Select doctor or hospital (with filters: specialization, gender, availability, location).

Step 2: Calendar UI with available slots.

Step 3: Appointment form (patient details: name, age, gender, symptoms/reason).

Step 4: Review & confirm appointment.

Success confirmation screen with booking details.

Doctor/Hospital Profile Page

Doctor details: name, specialization, experience, ratings, availability.

Option to "Book Appointment" directly.

Patient Dashboard

View upcoming & past appointments.

Reschedule or cancel appointments.

Notifications/reminders (UI only).

Responsive Design

Mobile-first layouts with smooth navigation.

Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines).

UI/UX Requirements:

Color scheme: calming, healthcare-friendly (light blues, greens, whites).

Typography: clean & readable (sans-serif like Inter or Roboto).

Forms: minimal, step-by-step, error states, validation messages.

Calendar: intuitive, easy to select available slots.

Buttons: rounded, clear CTAs (primary: Book Appointment, secondary: Reschedule/Cancel).

Technical Requirements:

Framework: React.js (with functional components & hooks).

Styling: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI.

Component Library: Use shadcn/ui for forms, cards, buttons.

State Management: Context API or lightweight state (no backend needed now).

Routing: React Router (for dashboard, profile pages).

Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast checks.

Deliverables:

Pixel-perfect, responsive frontend with mock data (no backend integration).

Figma-style UI with reusable components.

Clean file structure for scalability.

Working demo with navigation flow (Landing → Booking → Confirmation → Dashboard).
